# Build Your Portfolio Out To A Personal Site

**With CSS Style and Flexbox Layout**

### How Is A Personal Site Different From A Portfolio?

You have a lot more freedom here. You can link to as many external sites as you want, embed other sites or videos or social media feeds, have different internal sections you link to, and so much more.

Since you last touched this kinda thing, you've gained a LOT of skills. Use them!

### Getting Started

- Make a new REPL (CSS/HTML/JS).
- DON'T copy your content from your portfolio, because:
  - This is really a new thing.
  - Even the stuff you do want to copy over will benefit from a re-think and a re-write.
- DO add content more befitting a personal site.

Then:

### CSS Style It!

Go crazy with style (rules) and _panache_ (rules).

### Flexbox It!

##### Add A Holy Grail Layout, with:

- sidebar
- header
- footer
- main area

##### Add Multiple Columns

Add multiple columns in your main area, for example:

- photos next to text
- multiple lists next to each other

##### Get All Your Ducks In A Row

`justify-content` all the things! Make the rows beautiful and laid out _exactly_ as you'd like. That's Flexbox!
